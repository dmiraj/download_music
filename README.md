# download_music
My script to keep my music on me, whenever, wherever.

This is a script I use to download my 'Playlists/Albums/Songs'

# INSTALLATION:
- You need python bs4 module: `pip install bs4`.
- Then simply clone the repository: `git clone https://www.github.com/dmiraj/download_music`.
- Before downloading anything you need to edit the variable that indicates that path to the cloned repository. `repo_dir=/path/to/cloned/repo`. All the rest of variables in the script will use it as a reference.

# CONFIGURATION:
- By default, the script will download the objects (playlists, albums, liked-songs) in your `~/Music` directory. You can change it to another one: `music_directory=/path/to/music/direcotry`
